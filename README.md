`fffi` is a tool to transparently use shared libraries generated by Fortran in
Python with NumPy arrays. It is based on CFFI and currently assumes the use of
gfortran or Intel Fortran.

The focus of `fffi` is dynamical automatic generation of interfaces directly
within Python with a minimum of extra code generation and files to allow
for the simplest possible workflow for fast prototyping of Python/Fortran codes.
In this sense it complements [F2x](https://github.com/DLR-SC/F2x) which
instead supplies interfaces based on generated code and ISO C bindings.
Both tools aim to be more powerful and flexible alternatives to `F2Py`.

The following example can be found in `tests/01_arrays` directory and shows
basic usage using CFFI (fast) API mode with a shared library
`libtest_arrays.so` containing a module `mod_arrays`:
1. Import fffi and initialize `fortran_module` object `mod_arrays`
```python
from fffi import FortranModule
mod_arrays = FortranModule('test_arrays', 'mod_arrays')
```

2. Define and generate Python extension
  (only on first run or if library routines have been added/changed)
```python
mod_arrays.fdef("""
  subroutine test_vector(vec)
    double precision, dimension(:) :: vec
  end

  subroutine test_array_2d(arr)
    double precision, dimension(:,:) :: arr
  end
""")
mod_arrays.compile()
```
Internally, C function headers are generated for CFFI with the required
representation of array descriptors by the used Fortran compiler.

3. Load interface module to library
```python
  mod_arrays.load()
```
4. Calling of a subroutine `test_vector` in `mod_arrays` is as simple as
```python
  vec = np.ones(15)
  mod_arrays.test_vector(vec)
```

The general workflow to extend such a test is:

1. Possibly add new testing routines to `mod_arrays.f90` and `test_arrays.f90`
2. Run `make`. This generates a shared library `libtest_arrays.so` and
   a Fortran executable `test_arrays.x` for reference output
3. Edit and run `test1_arrays.py`

Current status:

* Code generation and invocation is transparent by encapsulation in Python class
* CFFI API mode is used (pre-generate C extension module as a wrapper)
* Subroutine signature definition in Fortran via `fdef` like CFFI `cdef`
* Array descriptor structs are working with gfortran 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Intel Fortran 18

Next steps:

* Add flexibility with regard to types, floating-point precision, etc.
* More testing, in particular with Intel compiler
* Test numpy.array views on existing data and memory management behavior
* Allow for ABI mode in addition to API mode, and static library API mode
* Add support and PGI compiler
* Test in real world applications
